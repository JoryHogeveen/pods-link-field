Add the Pods link field type to Pods versions prior to the upcoming 2.7 major release

This is a temporary plugin untill Pods 2.7 gets it's official release.

**Features added (not in Pods 2.7 dev yet)**
- Option to set the default `target` value
- Prepopulate the URL value for the field UI when it was a `text` or `website` field before.
